  "summary": "The implementation successfully delivers comprehensive video and course settings editors with validation, thumbnail/image upload support, and a personalized course recommendations section. The backend provides a recommendation API that considers user activity (watch history, likes, comments, channel follows). All requirements appear to be implemented with appropriate validation, access control, and UI feedback.",
